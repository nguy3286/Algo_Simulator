# Algorithm Tracer

**Description**

This tool allows you to trace the execution of popular/interesting algorithms (such as the two pointer approach for the Two Sum problem) on entered input.

**How to try it out**

The landing page should look similar to the screenshot below. You can either click _Run Demo_ or enter an array for nums (array start with '[' and end with ']')

**Features to add**

* A debugger style variable tracker

* Buttons to speedup, slowdown, and pause execution

* Additional algorithms problems (Island Count, Maximum Subarray Sum, etc.)

**Bugs**

* An interrupt needs to occurr when _Run Input_ or _Run Demo_ is clicked to halt execution of any uncompleted _Run Input_ or _Run Demo_ events
